# cython_scripts

a couple of cython compile to binary patterns

# Makefile
Makefile - traditional makefile which makes it easier to pull cython into a makefile-oriented build chain
  - example pattern
  - if you're building cython libraries, add some setup.py
  
# cy  
cy - a simple command-line bash wrapper
   - compile a cython .pyx file to binary
   - usage: cy ./file (less .pyx suffix)
   - useful for simple .pyx files
